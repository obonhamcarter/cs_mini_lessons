## 🎯 What is CS Quest?

CS Quest is a collection of interactive mini-lessons designed to make learning computer science **fun**, **engaging**, and **hands-on**. Each quest takes about 5 minutes and includes:

- 📖 An exciting story or scenario
- 💡 Clear explanations with examples
- 🎮 Interactive challenges and puzzles
- 👨‍💻 Python code you can edit and run
- ✅ Solutions to check your work


These lessons are perfect for beginners who want to learn the basics of programming, as well as for anyone looking to refresh their coding skills in a fun way! Questions and feedback are always welcome!
