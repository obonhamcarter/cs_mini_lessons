# Special Notes

## Understanding Browser Storage

Any code that you leave in JupyterLite notebooks is only stored in your browser's cache. This temporary storage means your files **will be deleted** if you:
- Empty your browser cache
- Clear your browser history or browsing data
- Use private/incognito browsing mode

**Important**: Do not rely on browser cache for permanent storage of your work.

## How to Permanently Save Your Notebook

To save your notebook so it can be archived, shared, or used on other machines, you must **download** the file from JupyterLite:

1. Look at the file menu on the right side of JupyterLite
2. Right-click on your notebook filename, or find the "Download" option in the menu
3. Save the `.ipynb` file to your local computer
4. Your notebook is now permanently stored and can be shared

## How to Reuse a Saved Notebook

To open and work with a previously saved notebook file:

1. Open JupyterLite in your browser
2. Find the "Upload Files" icon in the file menu on the right
3. Select the `.ipynb` notebook file from your computer
4. The notebook will be uploaded and ready to use

## Best Practices

- **Download frequently**: Save a local copy of your work after each session
- **Use meaningful names**: Name your notebooks clearly to track different assignments or projects
- **Keep backups**: Store downloaded notebooks in a safe location or cloud storage
- **Share easily**: The downloaded `.ipynb` files can be emailed, shared via cloud storage, or used in other Jupyter environments
