## 📖 Introduction: The Repetitive Task

Imagine you need to knock on 100 doors to find the magic door. Would you write:

```python
knock_on_door_1()
knock_on_door_2()
knock_on_door_3()
# ... 97 more lines ... 😱
knock_on_door_100()
```

That's ridiculous! There's a better way: **loops**! Loops let you repeat actions without writing the same code over and over.

::: {.story-box}
**🚪 Story Time**: You're searching for a magic portal in a hallway with 100 doors. Instead of checking each door one by one in your code, you can tell your program: "Check all doors until you find the magic one!" That's the power of loops!

## 💡 Explanation: Two Types of Loops

Python has two main types of loops:

### 🔁 For Loops
Use when you know how many times to repeat (or when iterating through a collection).

```python
# Repeat exactly 5 times
for i in range(5):
    print(f"This is repetition {i}")
```

### 🔄 While Loops
Use when you repeat until a condition becomes False.

```python
# Repeat while condition is True
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count is {count}")
    count += 1
```

::: {.concept-box}
**🎯 The `range()` Function**:

`range()` generates a sequence of numbers:

```python
range(5)        # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (5 numbers starting from 0)
range(1, 6)     # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from 1 to 5)
range(0, 10, 2) # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (from 0 to 8, step by 2)
```

**Remember**: `range(5)` starts at 0 and stops BEFORE 5!

## 🎮 Activity: Countdown to Launch!

Let's create a rocket launch countdown:

```{pyodide-python}
# Countdown with a for loop
print("🚀 ROCKET LAUNCH COUNTDOWN 🚀")
print()

for seconds in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(f"T-minus {seconds} seconds...")

print("🔥 LIFTOFF! 🔥")
print()

# Counting treasures
treasures = ["Gold Coin", "Ruby", "Diamond", "Emerald", "Ancient Scroll"]

print("📦 Inventory Check:")
for treasure in treasures:
    print(f"  ✨ Found: {treasure}")

print()
print(f"Total treasures: {len(treasures)}")

# Try adding more treasures to the list!
```

::: {.challenge-box}
**🎯 Challenge**: Modify the code to:

1. Make the countdown start from 5 instead of 10
2. Add two more treasures to the list
3. Make the countdown say "Get ready!" when it reaches 3
:::

## 👨‍💻 Code Example: While Loop Adventure

While loops are great when you don't know exactly how many times to repeat:

```{pyodide-python}
# Searching for treasure with a while loop
import random

print("🗺️ TREASURE HUNT ADVENTURE")
print()

# Set a random target location between 1 and 10
treasure_location = random.randint(1, 10)
current_location = 1
steps = 0

print("Searching for treasure...")
print()

while current_location != treasure_location:
    steps += 1
    print(f"Step {steps}: Checking location {current_location}... ❌ No treasure here!")
    current_location += 1

print(f"Step {steps + 1}: Checking location {current_location}... 💎 TREASURE FOUND!")
print()
print(f"Total steps taken: {steps + 1}")

# Run this multiple times - the number of steps changes each time!
```

::: {.tip-box}
**💡 Avoid Infinite Loops!**

Be careful with while loops. If the condition never becomes False, your loop runs forever!

**Bad example** (don't run this!):
```python
# while True:     # Never ends!
#     print("Forever...")
```

Always make sure your loop has a way to stop!
:::

## 🧩 Puzzle Time!

What will this code print? Predict it, then run:

```{pyodide-python}
# The Mystery Loop
total = 0
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    total = total + count
    count = count + 1

print(f"Final total: {total}")
print(f"Final count: {count}")

# Can you figure out why total is that number?
# Trace through the loop step by step!
```

::: {.solution-box}
**🔑 Solution Explained**:

The output is:
```
Final total: 15
Final count: 6
```

**Let's trace through each iteration**:

| Iteration | count | total before | total after |
|-----------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Start     | 1     | 0            | 0           |
| 1st loop  | 1     | 0            | 0+1 = 1     |
| 2nd loop  | 2     | 1            | 1+2 = 3     |
| 3rd loop  | 3     | 3            | 3+3 = 6     |
| 4th loop  | 4     | 6            | 6+4 = 10    |
| 5th loop  | 5     | 10           | 10+5 = 15   |
| Loop ends | 6     | 15           | 15          |

**Why count is 6**: After the 5th iteration, count becomes 6 (count = 5 + 1), which makes the condition `count <= 5` False, so the loop stops.

**Pattern recognized**: The code calculates 1+2+3+4+5 = 15!
:::

## 🎮 Bonus: Nested Loops

You can put loops inside loops! This is great for grids and patterns:

```{pyodide-python}
# Draw a grid pattern
print("Drawing a 5x5 grid of stars:")
print()

for row in range(5):
    for col in range(5):
        print("⭐", end=" ")
    print()  # New line after each row

print()
print("Now a pyramid:")
print()

for row in range(1, 6):
    for star in range(row):
        print("⭐", end=" ")
    print()

# Try changing the range values to make different patterns!
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

::: {.quest-complete}
### ✨ Quest 4 Complete! ✨

You've learned:

✅ `for` loops repeat a specific number of times  
✅ `while` loops repeat while a condition is True  
✅ `range()` generates sequences of numbers  
✅ Loops can iterate through lists and other collections  
✅ Avoid infinite loops by ensuring your condition can become False  
✅ Nested loops create patterns and grids

## 🚀 Try This at Home!

Create a simple times table generator:

```python
# Times table for any number
number = 7  # Change this to any number

print(f"Times table for {number}:")
for i in range(1, 11):
    result = number * i
    print(f"{number} × {i} = {result}")
```

Or make a guessing game hint system:

```python
secret_number = 42
guesses = 0
max_guesses = 5

while guesses < max_guesses:
    guesses += 1
    guess = int(input(f"Guess {guesses}/{max_guesses}: "))
    
    if guess == secret_number:
        print("🎉 You got it!")
        break
    elif guess < secret_number:
        print("📈 Too low!")
    else:
        print("📉 Too high!")
```
