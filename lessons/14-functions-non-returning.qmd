## 📖 Introduction: Actions vs Rewards

In Quest 6, we learned functions that **return values** (like spells that give you rewards). But not all functions need to return something. Some just need to **do something**.

**Two types of function outcomes:**

1. **With Return** 🎁: The function calculates and gives you a result
   ```python
   def calculate_damage(attack, defense):
       return attack - defense  # Returns a value
   ```

2. **Without Return** 🎭: The function performs an action (side effect)
   ```python
   def announce_victory(winner_name):
       print(f"{winner_name} wins!")  # Doesn't return anything
   ```

::: {.story-box}
**🎪 Story Time**: Imagine a tavern where the Barkeep has two jobs. One job is mixing a potion (returns the potion). Another job is announcing the next quest to the crowd (just tells everyone, doesn't hand you anything). Both are important functions!

## 💡 Explanation: Side Effects

A **side effect** is something a function does *besides* returning a value:
- Print to screen
- Modify a list or variable
- Write to a file
- Display an image
- Update game state

::: {.concept-box}
**🎯 Functions Without Return Values**

These functions often have `print()` statements or modify variables **outside** the function.

```python
def level_up_player(player_stats):
    """Modifies player_stats in place"""
    player_stats['level'] += 1
    player_stats['experience'] = 0
    print(f"🌟 Level up! Now level {player_stats['level']}")
    # Notice: No 'return' statement!

# The function CHANGED the data but didn't return anything
```

**When return is omitted, the function returns `None`**:
```python
result = level_up_player(player)
print(result)  # Prints: None
```
:::

## 🎮 Activity 1: Display Functions

Functions that show information to the player:

```{pyodide-python}
def display_character_sheet(name, level, health, mana):
    """Display a formatted character sheet"""
    print("╔════════════════════════════╗")
    print(f"║ CHARACTER: {name:<19}║")
    print("╠════════════════════════════╣")
    print(f"║ Level: {level:<21}║")
    print(f"║ Health: {health:<20}║")
    print(f"║ Mana: {mana:<23}║")
    print("╚════════════════════════════╝")
    # No return statement!

def announce_battle(player_name, enemy_name):
    """Announce the start of battle"""
    print(f"\n⚔️  BATTLE START! ⚔️")
    print(f"  {player_name} vs {enemy_name}")
    print()

# Use the functions
display_character_sheet("Hero", 5, 80, 40)
announce_battle("Hero", "Dark Knight")
```

## 🎮 Activity 2: Modifier Functions

Functions that **change** data:

```{pyodide-python}
def add_to_inventory(inventory, item, quantity=1):
    """Add items to an inventory list"""
    for _ in range(quantity):
        inventory.append(item)
    print(f"  ✅ Added {quantity} {item}(s) to inventory")
    # No return - we modified the list directly!

def remove_from_inventory(inventory, item):
    """Remove an item from inventory"""
    if item in inventory:
        inventory.remove(item)
        print(f"  ❌ Removed: {item}")
    else:
        print(f"  ⚠️  {item} not found!")

# Create an inventory
my_items = []

print("Starting adventure...")
add_to_inventory(my_items, "Sword", 1)
add_to_inventory(my_items, "Health Potion", 3)
add_to_inventory(my_items, "Rope", 1)

print(f"\n📦 Inventory: {my_items}")

remove_from_inventory(my_items, "Rope")
print(f"📦 Inventory: {my_items}")
```

## 🎮 Activity 3: Mixed Functions

Often you'll want both: side effects AND return values:

```{pyodide-python}
def take_damage(current_health, damage):
    """Take damage and return new health"""
    new_health = current_health - damage
    
    # Side effect: Print what happened
    print(f"  ⚡ DAMAGE: -{damage}")
    print(f"  Current health: {new_health}")
    
    # Also return the new value
    return new_health

def heal_player(current_health, heal_amount, max_health=100):
    """Heal and return new health"""
    new_health = min(current_health + heal_amount, max_health)
    
    # Side effect: Show the healing
    healed = new_health - current_health
    if healed > 0:
        print(f"  💚 HEALED: +{healed}")
        print(f"  Current health: {new_health}")
    else:
        print(f"  ⚠️  Already at max health!")
    
    # Return the result
    return new_health

# Battle scenario
health = 100
print("⚔️  In battle!")
health = take_damage(health, 25)
health = take_damage(health, 15)
print()
health = heal_player(health, 30)
```

## 🧩 Challenge: Build a Logging Function

Write a function that:
1. Takes 3 parameters: `message`, `log_level` (like "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR"), and `player_name`
2. Prints a formatted log message with timestamp-like format
3. Does **not** return anything
4. Shows different emoji based on log level:
   - INFO: 📝
   - WARNING: ⚠️
   - ERROR: 🔴

```{pyodide-python}
# Challenge: Create a logging function

def log_message(message, log_level, player_name):
    """Log a game message with level and player name"""
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # Hint: Use if/elif to choose emoji based on level
    # Print something like: "[INFO] Player's Name: message"
    pass

# Test your function:
# log_message("Found treasure!", "INFO", "Hero")
# log_message("Low health!", "WARNING", "Hero")
# log_message("Defeated!", "ERROR", "Hero")
```

## ✅ Solution

```{pyodide-python}
def log_message(message, log_level, player_name):
    """Log a game message with level and player name"""
    emoji_map = {
        "INFO": "📝",
        "WARNING": "⚠️",
        "ERROR": "🔴"
    }
    
    emoji = emoji_map.get(log_level, "❓")
    print(f"[{emoji} {log_level}] {player_name}: {message}")
    # No return statement!

# Test the function
log_message("Found treasure!", "INFO", "Hero")
log_message("Low health!", "WARNING", "Hero")
log_message("Defeated by dragon!", "ERROR", "Hero")
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts

✨ Functions can do things **without** returning values (side effects)
✨ Common side effects: printing, modifying lists, updating state
✨ Some functions do BOTH: side effects AND return values
✨ A function without `return` returns `None`
✨ Side effect functions are great for "actions" in games!

## 🚀 What's Next?

You've learned functions that don't return, and earlier you learned functions that do. Next up: **Quest 15: Functions Part 3 - Returning Functions** where we dive deeper into writing excellent return-value functions!
