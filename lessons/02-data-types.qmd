## 📖 Introduction: The Shape-Shifting Treasure

You've discovered a mysterious treasure room with different types of treasures: gold coins (numbers), ancient scrolls (text), magical crystals (true/false), and floating price tags (decimals). Each type of treasure has unique properties and uses!

Just like treasures come in different forms, data in Python comes in different **types**. Understanding data types helps you know what you can and can't do with your information.

::: {.story-box}
**🏺 Story Time**: You find a magic box that only accepts certain types of items. You can't add a scroll to a pile of gold coins—they're different types! Similarly, in Python, you can't always mix different data types without converting them first.

## 💡 Explanation: The Main Data Types

Python has several built-in data types. Here are the most important ones:

### 🔢 Integers (int)
Whole numbers, positive or negative, with no decimal point.

```python
age = 15
score = 1000
temperature = -5
```

### 📏 Floats (float)
Numbers with decimal points.

```python
price = 19.99
pi = 3.14159
temperature = 98.6
```

### 📝 Strings (str)
Text enclosed in quotes (single or double).

```python
name = "Alex"
message = 'Hello, World!'
quote = "To code or not to code"
```

### ✅ Booleans (bool)
True or False values (note the capital T and F!).

```python
is_game_over = False
has_key = True
is_raining = False
```

::: {.concept-box}
**🔍 How to Check Data Types**:

Use the `type()` function to see what type something is:

```python
print(type(42))        # <class 'int'>
print(type(3.14))      # <class 'float'>
print(type("Hello"))   # <class 'str'>
print(type(True))      # <class 'bool'>
```

## 🎮 Activity: The Data Type Detective

Run this code to explore different data types:

```{pyodide-python}
# Let's investigate different types of data!

# Numbers
health = 100
damage = 15.5

# Text
player_name = "CodeMaster"
greeting = "Welcome to the adventure!"

# Boolean
is_alive = True
has_sword = False

# Let's see their types
print("=== DATA TYPE INVESTIGATION ===")
print(f"health ({health}) is type: {type(health)}")
print(f"damage ({damage}) is type: {type(damage)}")
print(f"player_name ({player_name}) is type: {type(player_name)}")
print(f"greeting ({greeting}) is type: {type(greeting)}")
print(f"is_alive ({is_alive}) is type: {type(is_alive)}")
print(f"has_sword ({has_sword}) is type: {type(has_sword)}")
```

::: {.challenge-box}
**🎯 Challenge**: Try these experiments:

1. Change `health` to `100.0` - what type is it now?
2. Change `player_name` to `12345` (without quotes) - what happens?
3. What happens if you write `is_alive = "True"` (with quotes)?

Run the code after each change and observe!

## 👨‍💻 Code Example: Working with Different Types

Different types support different operations:

```{pyodide-python}
# Math with numbers
coins = 10
found_coins = 5
total_coins = coins + found_coins
print(f"🪙 Math: {coins} + {found_coins} = {total_coins}")

# Combining strings (concatenation)
first_name = "Code"
last_name = "Warrior"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(f"📝 Strings: {first_name} + {last_name} = {full_name}")

# String multiplication (yes, really!)
laugh = "ha"
big_laugh = laugh * 5
print(f"😂 String * Number: {laugh} * 5 = {big_laugh}")

# Booleans in action
has_shield = True
has_armor = False
is_protected = has_shield or has_armor
print(f"🛡️ Boolean Logic: has_shield ({has_shield}) or has_armor ({has_armor}) = {is_protected}")
```

::: {.tip-box}
**💡 Watch Out!**: Mixing types can cause errors:

```python
# This works:
result = "Score: " + str(100)

# This doesn't work:
# result = "Score: " + 100  # Error! Can't add string and int
```

Use `str()`, `int()`, or `float()` to convert between types!

## 🧩 Puzzle Time!

What will happen with this code? Try to predict, then run it:

```{pyodide-python}
# Mystery code - what will print?
a = "10"
b = "20"
result1 = a + b

c = 10
d = 20
result2 = c + d

print(f"String addition: {a} + {b} = {result1}")
print(f"Number addition: {c} + {d} = {result2}")

# Why are the results different?
# Can you explain it?
```

::: {.solution-box}
**🔑 Solution Explained**:

The output is:
```
String addition: 10 + 20 = 1020
Number addition: 10 + 20 = 30
```

**Why?** 

- When you add **strings** (`"10" + "20"`), Python concatenates (joins) them together → `"1020"`
- When you add **integers** (`10 + 20`), Python performs mathematical addition → `30`

The `+` operator behaves differently depending on the data type! This is why understanding types is so important.

**Bonus**: What if you wanted to add those string numbers? You'd convert them first:
```python
result = int("10") + int("20")  # Result: 30
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

::: {.quest-complete}
### ✨ Quest 2 Complete! ✨

You've learned:

✅ Python has different data types: int, float, str, bool  
✅ Use `type()` to check what type a value is  
✅ Different types support different operations  
✅ You can convert between types using `int()`, `float()`, `str()`  
✅ The same operator can behave differently with different types

## 🚀 Try This at Home!

Create a simple "About Me" program using different data types:

```python
# All about you!
name = "Your Name"           # string
age = 15                     # integer
height = 5.5                 # float (in feet)
loves_coding = True          # boolean
favorite_number = 42         # integer

# Print everything with their types
print(f"Name: {name} (type: {type(name).__name__})")
print(f"Age: {age} (type: {type(age).__name__})")
# Add more...
```

Experiment with converting types and see what happens!
